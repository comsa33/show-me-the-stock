# Persistent Loading Issue Fix Documentation

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing persistent "Loading..." messages in ProfileView and WatchlistView that required `localStorage.clear()` to resolve. This indicated issues with session management and component lifecycle.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Race Conditions**: Components were updating state after unmounting
2. **Session Management**: Using `getUser()` instead of `getSession()` caused unnecessary network calls
3. **Loading State Management**: Complex loading logic caused components to get stuck in loading state
4. **Profile Creation Timing**: Background profile creation was blocking component rendering

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext Optimization (`/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `mounted` flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Moved to immediate loading state release after session check
- Made profile creation truly asynchronous (background process)
- Session check now completes immediately, not waiting for profile creation

### 2. ProfileView Simplification (`/src/components/auth/ProfileView.tsx`)
- Added proper loading state with immediate resolution
- Added `mounted` flag to prevent race conditions
- Simplified error handling with fallback values
- Profile creation now happens in background without blocking UI

### 3. WatchlistService Performance (`/src/services/watchlistService.ts`)
- Changed from `getUser()` to `getSession()` for faster authentication checks
- Added helper function `getCurrentUserId()` to reduce API calls
- This change reduces authentication overhead on every watchlist operation

### 4. Session Debug Component (`/src/components/debug/SessionDebug.tsx`)
- Created temporary debug component to monitor session state
- Shows real-time session information for troubleshooting
- Can be removed once issue is confirmed fixed

### 5. SQL RLS Policies (`/src/sql/009_check_rls_policies.sql`)
- Created comprehensive RLS policy setup script
- Ensures proper row-level security for all user tables
- Prevents potential access issues that could cause loading problems

## Performance Improvements Based on Supabase Best Practices

1. **Use `getSession()` instead of `getUser()`**:
   - `getSession()` reads from local storage (fast)
   - `getUser()` makes a network request (slow)
   - Only use `getUser()` when you need verified user data

2. **Immediate Loading State Resolution**:
   - Don't wait for all operations to complete before showing UI
   - Release loading state as soon as basic data is available
   - Perform secondary operations (like profile creation) in background

3. **Proper Component Lifecycle Management**:
   - Always use `mounted` flags in useEffect hooks
   - Clean up subscriptions and prevent state updates after unmount
   - Handle errors gracefully with fallback values

## Testing the Fix

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to ProfileView - should load immediately
3. Navigate to WatchlistView - should load immediately
4. Refresh the page - components should still load without issues
5. Check the SessionDebug component (bottom-right corner) for session status

## Removing Debug Component

Once the issue is confirmed fixed, remove the debug component:

1. Remove import from `/src/App.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   // Remove this line
   import SessionDebug from './components/debug/SessionDebug';
   ```

2. Remove component from render:
   ```tsx
   // Remove these lines
   {/* Temporary debug component - remove after fixing loading issue */}
   <SessionDebug />
   ```

3. Delete the debug component file:
   ```bash
   rm src/components/debug/SessionDebug.tsx
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The old ProfileView is saved as `ProfileView.old.tsx` for reference
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No database schema changes required
- RLS policies should be applied via Supabase dashboard if not already present
